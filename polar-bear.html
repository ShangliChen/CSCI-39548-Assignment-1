        <h2>About the Polar Bear</h2>
        <p>Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are large bears that live in the Arctic region. They are strong swimmers and primarily hunt seals on sea ice. Polar bears have thick fur and a layer of fat that helps them survive in extremely cold temperatures.</p>
        <p>Adult males can weigh between 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb), while adult females are smaller. Polar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their life on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
